/* ---- THE PER-QUERY SOLVER BUDGET (--path-cov-claim-timeout) --------------
 *
 * Path coverage decides one INDEPENDENT claim per job, so a single pathological
 * query costs the entire run and takes every already-decided result with it.
 * MEASURED: one run spent ~166 of its 180 s inside the FIRST solver query,
 * never got an answer, never asked the other nine claims, and produced nothing
 * -- on a few hundred MB against 40 GB free. Raising --memlimit or the outer
 * timeout routes AROUND that query; a per-query budget refuses to pay for it.
 *
 * ENFORCED BY THE SOLVER, NOT BY KILLING THE PROCESS. Each backend that has a
 * native per-check limit sets it at construction from `optionst`, which every
 * backend already receives. The limit is per check-sat, and under path coverage
 * a fresh solver is built per claim, so per-check == per-claim.
 *
 * A backend with no such facility must SAY SO rather than silently run
 * unbounded: `smt_timeout_mechanism()` is empty until a backend records one,
 * and the caller publishes "no enforcement" when it stays empty. A budget that
 * is quietly not applied is worse than no budget, because the report would
 * carry `claim_timeout_s: 120` for a run nothing bounded.
 *
 * Header-only on purpose: the three backends live in three separate static
 * libraries, and an inline function's local static is one object across all of
 * them under C++17 -- no new translation unit, no CMake change, no link-order
 * question.
