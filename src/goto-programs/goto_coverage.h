  // defect makes that claim false — and it has absorbed one three times already
  // (ordinal-key mismatch, the RETURN exit, `rawBalances`). Each time the broken
  // case was indistinguishable from an honest solver timeout, because "we do not
  // know" is a legitimate, expected outcome.
  //
  // So every U must be classifiable, and a U that is not is a HARD FAILURE
  // rather than a quiet residue. The tokens:
  //
  //   named-obstacle      the unit is disqualified (the model admits an
  //                       execution the chain does not have). Not an unknown at
  //                       all — a declared exclusion that no verdict can change.
  //   bounded-holds       the solver proved no witness AT THIS EXPLORATION.
  //                       Honest and precise: it is not "unreachable", it is
  //                       "no witness within the declared tx/unwind bound from
  //                       the post-constructor entry state".
  //   solver-unknown      the solver returned UNKNOWN/error, or an inductive
  //                       step could not prove it. The genuine "we do not know".
  //   not-solved-this-run the claim was instrumented but never reached the
  //                       solver. The entry-liveness audit catches the case
  //                       where a WHOLE unit is in this state; this token is
  //                       exactly the per-claim residue it cannot see.
  //   unit-not-entered    the harness never entered this path's unit, so no
  //                       classification of the path itself means anything.
  //
  // ORDER MATTERS, and `unit-not-entered` must sit SECOND — directly under
  // named-obstacle and ABOVE the two tokens that would otherwise swallow it:
  //
  //   * a unit that is entered but whose claims hold vacuously gets verdict 'P'
  //     and would be filed `bounded-holds` — "no witness within the bound",
  //     which is a statement about the path when the truth is that nothing ran;
  //   * a unit whose claims were never generated at all (measured on a real
  //     benchmark: 120166 instrumented paths, ZERO verification conditions) has
  //     no verdict and would be filed `not-solved-this-run`.
  //
  // Both are strictly less informative than the real reason, so putting them
  // first loses the one fact worth having. The ordering rule is the same one
  // that puts named-obstacle at the top: when the unit is disqualified, or was
  // never entered, every finer classification of its paths is meaningless.
  //
  // WHAT USED TO FIRE THIS, AND WHY IT NO LONGER DOES. The live producer was
  // --focus-function: the pass instrumented every unit while the dispatcher
  // entered one, so the excluded units' paths reached the report and were filed
  // here (measured before the ordering was fixed, they were reported
  // `not-solved-this-run` on a run whose own log line one line earlier said the
  // unit had not been entered). Since --focus-function narrows INSTRUMENTATION
  // (see `focus_function`), those units produce no claims at all, so on a
  // COMPLETE run `units_not_entered` can only ever name the focused unit — and
  // that is a hard failure in audit_entry_liveness, not a token.
  //
  // The slot is therefore reached today only on a PARTIAL run, where the audit
  // downgrades its abort to a warning and the un-entered units are the ones the
  // run stopped before reaching. It is kept, and kept SECOND, because the
  // ordering argument above is about what the token MEANS, not about how often
  // it occurs: a claim of a unit nothing entered must not be filed under a
  // verdict-derived token whatever put it there.
  //
  // This is an INVARIANT ASSERTION, not a detector: the live tokens partition
  // the possible states by construction (a claim's verdict is one of
  // {none, P, U, F}, and F means witnessed, hence not U). It therefore needs no
  // fault injection — its value is as a tripwire for a future change that
  // introduces a U with no reason. THE PARTITION ARGUMENT ONLY HOLDS WHILE THE
  // CLASSIFICATION HAS NO CATCH-ALL: the implementation's `default` arm returns
  // "" so the caller aborts. Mapping `default` to any token instead would make
  // the abort dead code while everything still looked fine — do not add one when
  // a fifth verdict value appears; add an explicit case for it.

  // ENTRY-LIVENESS AUDIT — hard-fails when a unit's results are vacuous.
  //
  // Measured on a real benchmark (St1inch): 120166 paths were instrumented and
  // symex generated ZERO verification conditions — the harness never called any
  // unit. Every path was then reported "U", which is indistinguishable from an
  // honest solver timeout, so a completely empty run looked like a merely hard
  // one. Nothing crashed and nothing warned; the defect was found by a human
  // reading a log line.
  //
  // Two levels of the same failure, deliberately sharing ONE channel so that
  // implementing half of it cannot leave the other half silent:
  //   * a unit whose claims never reached the solver was never entered;
  //   * zero verification conditions overall is the extreme case of that, where
  //     EVERY unit was never entered.
  //
  // The witness is positive: a claim that produced a solver verdict proves the
  // unit was executed. Absence of a verdict is not read as "undecided" — for a
  // whole unit it is read as "this run says nothing about this unit", which is
  // a tool failure, not a result. Claims deliberately skipped via the cross-run
  // covered set are excluded, since not instrumenting them is intentional.
  //
  // This is also what currently makes it safe to keep `I` disabled: if
  // unreachability were ever emitted, a never-entered unit would have every one
  // of its `assert(tr != enc)` hold vacuously and be reported as PROVEN
  // INFEASIBLE — the most damaging wrong answer this pass could give. The audit
  // is the precondition for ever enabling it.
  // `focus_function` is --focus-function's value, empty when unset. With it set
  // the dispatcher deliberately calls only that entry, so every OTHER unit is
  // legitimately never entered and must not be treated as a defect — measured:
  // the first real use of this audit aborted on exactly that. The premise
  // ("a unit with instrumented claims should be entered") only holds for the
  // focused unit, so the check is narrowed to where it holds rather than
  // weakened everywhere.
  //
  // SINCE --focus-function ALSO NARROWS INSTRUMENTATION (see `focus_function`),
  // the excluded units have no claims, so `all_claims` holds the focused unit's
  // paths and nothing else. The `dead_by_design` branch below is therefore
  // unreachable on a complete run, and the audit's HARD FAILURE now covers the
  // focused unit itself — a strengthening: a focused run whose one unit was
  // never entered used to be reported as a normal per-method result and is now
  // a defect. The narrowing is KEPT rather than deleted because it is the
  // property that makes the abort safe, and deleting it would leave nothing

  // harness may call. This narrows the OTHER half: solidity_path_coverage()
  // enumerates and instruments path claims for THIS unit only.
  //
  // WHY, and it is not performance. A focused run used to instrument the whole
  // contract's path set, so the numbers it published were CONTRACT-level while
  // reading as the unit's. MEASURED on aqua `--focus-function dock`:
  //
  //     Complete Paths : 2846    Reached : 2    Path Coverage: 0.07%
  //
  // 2783 of those 2846 belong to units the dispatcher cannot enter in this run,
  // so no exploration could ever witness them. The honest denominator is
  // `dock`'s own 63 paths, i.e. 3.17% -- the published metric was wrong by 45x,
  // and `summary.paths_total` carried the same contract-level number into
  // cov-report.json, where it has already been misread as the unit's.
  //
  // The time saving is a SIDE EFFECT AND A SMALL ONE; do not quote it as the
  // reason. Focus already narrowed the solve stage (symex never reaches a
  // non-focused unit's assert -- aqua `dock`: 2846 instrumented, 63 VCCs), so
  // the only phase this can compress is the instrumentation pass itself, billed
  // to `GOTO program processing time`: measured 0.20-1.80 s across the corpus,
  // against a `GOTO program creation time` of 1.1-13.4 s that is the FRONTEND's
  // Solidity->GOTO conversion and is not affected by this at all.
  //
  // ---- WHAT THIS MUST NOT NARROW: the EXPANSION loop ----
  //
  // solidity_path_coverage() walks goto_functions TWICE: first to expand
  // internal calls physically into each unit (sol_path_inlinet::expand_here)
  // and to run degradation, then to enumerate and instrument. ONLY THE SECOND
  // LOOP IS NARROWED.
  //
  // The first must not be, and the reason is mechanical rather than cautious:
  // `expand_here` copies the callee's body AS IT IS AT THAT MOMENT, and the
  // expansion loop rewrites each unit's body in place as it goes. So a unit C
  // that the loop reaches BEFORE a unit F is already expanded when F splices it
  // in, and F gets one further level of call depth for free. Skipping
  // non-focused units there -- or merely skipping their degradation, which also
  // rewrites their bodies -- would change what lands inside the focused unit,
  // and every `enc` would silently mean something else: a smaller, faster run
  // with different answers. Leaving the loop alone keeps the focused unit's body
  // BIT-IDENTICAL to its body in a whole-contract run, which is also what makes
  // the covered-set argument below hold.
  //
  // The price is stated rather than optimised away: a focused run still pays the
  // whole contract's expansion and degradation cost.

  // ---- --path-cov-instrument-only: DISPATCH WIDE, INSTRUMENT NARROW ----
  //
  // Set from --path-cov-instrument-only; empty when unset, and then this
  // narrowing does not exist and behaviour is bit-identical to before.
  //
  // WHY IT IS A SECOND OPTION AND NOT A CHANGE TO THE FIRST. `--focus-function`
  // answers two different questions with one value, and they are only the same
  // question by coincidence:
  //
  //   * WHICH ENTRIES THE HARNESS MAY CALL -- the dispatcher alphabet
  //     (solidity_convert_constructor.cpp's `get_unbound_function`);
  //   * WHICH UNITS ARE ENUMERATED AND INSTRUMENTED -- the published
  //     denominator (the narrowing just above).
  //
  // A state-guarded path needs the first to be WIDE (someone has to establish
  // the state; one transaction is exactly one entry call, so a second letter in
  // the alphabet is the only way another unit ever runs) and the second to stay
  // NARROW (the unit under test is one unit, and its denominator must not move
  // or the ladder's cells stop being comparable).
  //
  // MEASURED, and this option exists because of it. aqua `dock` at
  // `--focus-function dock,ship`: `dock` alone enumerates 63 paths, `ship`
  // enumerates 2733, and the run instrumented 2796 and was killed at the 300 s
  // outer timeout with no usable answer -- twice, at tx=1 and tx=2. The
  // widening that was supposed to buy ONE extra caller bought the widest unit
  // in the contract as well.
  //
  // ---- THE DIRECTION THAT IS SAFE, AND THE ONE THAT IS NOT ----
  //
  // `util/focus_function.h` argues that the dispatcher filter and the
  // instrumentation filter must not disagree, and it is right about the
  // direction it names: a unit the dispatcher CAN enter but nothing
  // instruments is an invisible zero in the numerator. This option is the
  // OPPOSITE containment and it is checked, not assumed:
  //
  //     instrument_only  SUBSET OF  focus_function
  //
  // so every instrumented unit is still enterable. The dispatch site REFUSES a
  // value that is not a subset rather than silently intersecting -- an
  // instrumented unit the harness cannot enter would report every one of its
  // paths `unit-not-entered`, which reads as "nothing reaches this code" and is
  // actually "nothing was asked to".
  //
  // What it does NOT change: the expansion loop, the ABI gate, Phase-1 `tr`
  // accounting, both censuses. Same reasoning as the focus narrowing above --
  // the instrumented unit's body, and therefore every `enc`, every depth and
  // every stable path id, stays bit-identical to a whole-contract run's.
  std::string instrument_only = "";

  // Does `--focus-function focus` select the unit `unit_id`?

  // as "excluded by design" (informational) instead of as the hard failure it
  // is.

  // ---- Coordinates the tool REFUSED to express, and why ----
  //
  // Two things can make a coordinate unusable, and they used to be one thing:
  // an ABORT. The name may not resolve (a mapping, a field access like
  // `immutables.taker`), or it may resolve to a value this stage cannot bound
  // (a string, a contract/interface handle, an aggregate — the SMT layer then
  // dies with "Projecting from non-tuple based AST" or a "Tuple AST mismatch"
  // assertion, i.e. a core dump instead of a recorded failure). Measured five
  // times across three projects and three different types; unrecognised types
  // are unbounded in number, so the rule is REFUSE BY DEFAULT with a whitelist
  // of what can be bounded, not accept-by-default with a crash on the unknown.
  //
  // Recorded rather than silently omitted. In the query, "the box omits c" and
  // "c is unconstrained" are the SAME constraint — so a refused coordinate that
  // simply vanished from the report would read as "measured, and it came out as
  // the whole type", which is a claim about a measurement that never happened.
  //
  // The refusal is NOT symmetric between the two stages, and the asymmetry is
  // the point:
  //   * OUTER BOX — refuse the coordinate, keep measuring the others. The box
  //     is a containment statement per coordinate; one missing coordinate costs
  //     information, not correctness. It must never be treated as a measured
  //     `[0, TYPE_MAX]` bound for THIS path, which would widen this path's own
  //     region and break the only-ever-narrower invariant.
  //   * CERTIFY — refuse the QUERY. Dropping a requested bound and answering
  //     SUCCESSFUL would certify a WIDER box than the one asked for, which is
  //     the single outcome that query exists to prevent.

  //
  // The region is ASSUMED at unit entry. Every structural gate on it is
  // SYNTACTIC -- lo > hi, a name bounded twice, holes that empty the interval,
  // a decimal outside the coordinate's type. None of them can see that the
  // region is unsatisfiable SEMANTICALLY, and that is the common case rather
  // than an exotic one: contract state is not havoc'd at `--solidity-max-tx 1`,
  // so `state.x in [0,0]` against a constructor that assigns 7 is well-formed,
  // in-type, non-empty, and admits no execution at all. An unsatisfiable
  // assumption makes EVERY candidate hold for want of an execution, and the
  // ladder then prints a full set of certified post-state assertions about a
  // region that contains nothing.
  //
  // So one extra claim is emitted at pi's OWN exit carrying only the antecedent,
  // `tr != enc || cnt != depth`. It is REFUTED exactly when some execution
  // admitted by the region walks THIS path -- which is the property the whole
  // ladder is conditioned on. Placing it at ENTRY instead would only witness
  // that the unit is reachable, which is a strictly weaker statement and would
  // pass on a region that reaches the unit but never this path.
